# [FileSaver](https://bin.webduino.io/sevon/1/edit?output)
Use a card reader to encrypt your files to reduce a bunch of complex encryption and security technologies.

Just three steps, swipe , upload , encrypt!

# Introduction
Hello, we are **EnterTextHere**. 

Have you ever been that you are keying the password ,but you can’t remember the pass word?

Maybe, you should click the “forgot memory?”, then after the complex process , you got your pass word.  

In this situation, if you have our product “ file saver”,you could avoid this misery.

Our main idea is that we could use only three step to memory our password instead of memory by brain.
