# FileSaver
Use a card reader to encrypt your files to reduce a bunch of complex encryption and security technologies.

Just three steps, swipe , upload , encrypt!

# Introduction
Hello, we are EnterTextHere. 

Have you ever been that you are keying the password ,
but you can’t remember the pass word?
Maybe, you should click the “forgot memory?” 
,then after the complex process , you got your pass word.  

In this situation, if you have our product “ file saver”,
you could avoid this misery.

our main idea is that we could use only three step to memory our password 
instead of memory by brain.
